         <h3>Music When Soft Voices Die (To —) by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h>
         <h5>
           <p>Music, when soft voices die</p>
           <p>Vibrates in the memory— </p>
           <p>Odours, when sweet violets sicken,</p>
           <p>Live within the sense they quicken.</p>
           <p>Rose leaves, when the rose is dead,</p>
           <p>Are heaped for the belovèd's bed;</p>
           <p>And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,</p>
           <p>Love itself shall slumber on.</p>
        </h5>
